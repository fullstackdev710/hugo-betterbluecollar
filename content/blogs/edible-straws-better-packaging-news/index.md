Love our edible straws, and wish you could support the company in more ways? We hear you loud and clear, and we’re planning on introducing new products to our range that will help you become that little bit more eco-friendly. We’re also a company that constantly works on improving our products, and the next update will be in package design. Continue reading to learn more.

If you’re new here, welcome! Through this blog, we hope to inform and educate, so our readers and customers are able to make an informed purchase, and so they can mindfully make changes in their life that will help them become more environmentally friendly. It’s no use pointing the finger at big corporations – nobody’s polluting the Earth out of spite. We’re all doing what we have to do, and what we can do. The only thing left is to try and make little changes to improve things – and that’s necessary both on an individual level, and a bigger, more organized level.

But enough of that! Let’s dive into the details you’re all here for, starting with…

## New and improved packaging

Ever since we launched our product, we have been changing, researching, and trying to improve. A while ago we partnered up with Seed The Change because we felt that was a step in the right direction. This partnership means that now for each product you buy, a small portion of the proceeds goes towards planting a tree. It’s at no extra cost to you, and you’re using an eco-friendly product while actively making the Earth greener in the process! Triple win.

Now, it’s time for another change, and this will be in the form of a packaging update. You’ll get our products in more attractive packaging that provides all the information you need in an easy-to-read manner. This might not seem like an important change, but in the world of marketing, every little bit counts. If we want our product to reach more people and influence more decisions, we need our packaging to stand out, and to tell the customer and as succinctly as possible why they should consider buying it. That’s what we’re headed towards with this little change.

Another change that we are working towards is getting rid of the plastic in our boxes. When you receive a box of our edible straws, you may have noticed that inside the box is a little plastic bag, and the straws are inside this bag. This is to keep humidity out and protect the product from damage, since it is, after all, food. However, unlike what many think, this material isn’t actually plastic. It’s like plastic but not exactly the same. It’s closer to waxed paper than to plastic, and is biodegradable over time.

We included this so far because it served a necessary purpose, and didn’t cause much harm to the planet. However, we think we can do better, and we’ve finally found a solution that’ll do it. So when the new packaging is ready, be prepared for another little change!

## Adding new products to the website

We are proud of our edible straws and truly think they can make a difference in the world – as many of our users confirm! However, we wanted to do more.

For a while now, we’ve been working on more eco-friendly products that can make eating a fun experience without damaging the environment. From bowls to plates, reusable and disposable – we’ll have some interesting variety on the website. We want to keep the details a secret just now, but as soon as things are finalized, you’ll be the first to know!

If there is a particular product you’d like us to try out, let us know! You can reach us through our website, and let us know what you’d like us to add to our catalogue. We’ll talk and see if we can make it happen. We’re very interested in learning and growing, and in helping the planet in more ways. After all, that’s what this blog is – it’s another way to reach potential readers and viewers, who might learn something new and make a change in their consumption habits!

If you’ve been looking for more ways to help the planet, you won’t have to wait long. Of course, in the meanwhile, you can reduce your food waste, create compost, minimize your plastic use, and buy from brands that produce their products in an ethical, environmentally-friendly manner.

We don’t like to talk about greenwashing too much because it necessitates pointing a finger at companies and villainizing them for doing what companies exist to do – fulfil a need and make a profit! However, if you truly care about the environment and are looking for more things to do to make your lifestyle green, we’d recommend reading up on greenwashing. The beauty and fashion industry are especially bad in this regard, so that could serve as an excellent starting point.

Coming back to the subject of our new products – you can expect another update in a few months’ time. Supply chains have been severely affected by the pandemic, and it is difficult to keep things moving the way they were. However, we’re hard at work, and we’re trying to make it happen as soon as we can!

## Unable to buy your favorite edible straws?

If you live in the US or Canada, you may have a hard time getting your hands on a box of edible straws, and that’s because we’ve been sold out in Canada, and are close to being sold out on US Amazon. This happens when demand outstrips supply – which, in this instance, has happened due to supply issues caused by COVID.

If you really love our straws, we’d recommend stocking up on them while you have the chance. Check Amazon if you’re in the US, and if they’re all sold out try our website.

Others can try going straw-free for a while, and see if it’s something they feel comfortable changing to. While our straws are perfectly eco-friendly and feel great to use, if you use a reusable cup without a straw, that’s certainly a step further! Just remember to use a straw when drinking drinks that can damage or stain your teeth, because straws cost less than dental work.

If you’re going to be having a party and need rice straws for drinks, plan ahead! It’s the kind of purchase people tend to leave for the last minute, but unless you want to buy (and clean) expensive reusable straws or have disgruntled guests trying to drink from soggy paper straws, you’ll have to think ahead. There are other alternatives like sugar straws too, but they just aren’t very healthy, and they’re almost certain to affect the taste of your drink.

If you have a pack lying around in your car or at the back of a kitchen shelf, now’s the time to go dig it out! Use the box before it expires, and by the time you’re done we’ll be restocked and you can order away with a couple clicks!

## Why you need to switch to edible straws

Our majestic sea creatures are dying at an alarming rate because they mistake our plastic garbage for food. From plastic food containers to drinking bottles and bottle caps, humans toss an estimated 8 million tons of toxic plastic into the world’s oceans every year. These break apart and turn into microplastics, and it’s these small pieces of brightly-colored and highly toxic plastic that can be mistaken for food by wildlife, fish, and marine animals.

Our 100% biodegradable edible drinking straws are the perfect alternative for those who want to help save the planet from global catastrophe. Our edible straws are ocean-friendly, and will decompose long before they reach any marine creatures. When dumped into landfills, they will quietly decompose instead of leaching toxic chemicals into the soil.

The edible straws are 10-inches long, making them perfect for drinking hot or cold drinks with. Use our drinking straws in juices, soft drinks, iced coffees and teas, and even in thick milkshakes and smoothies. There are 30 pasta straws per package, so one pack should last you about a month if you use a straw every day. These edible straws are very portable. Place them in your children’s lunch boxes, take them to restaurants, and keep a package in the car.

Flewid Friendly’s edible straws are long-lasting, staying usable for over an hour without getting soggy and waterlogged. There’s never a need to rush to finish your favorite beverage. All Flewid Friendly products are 100% biodegradable, all-natural, and manufactured without GMOs, BPAs, or micro-plastics. Just drink, and then eat or compost.

If you buy frequently, you may be able to avail discounts if you bookmark our product page and check back regularly. We have sales and discounts during holidays and special occasions, so you can stock up for that rocking party you’re about to have!
